To build the makefiles, run
cmake .
from the project directory.

To run the makefile (generate an executable from your code), run
make

To install your program in the directory specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, run
make install

To uninstall your program, delete the files found in
install_manifest.txt
or get fancy and run
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
which I haven't yet tried.

Be careful about conditionally including libraries/setting libraries with options. You may need to:
    add a preprocessor define (#cmakedefine) to <project>Config.h.in
    set the option() to ON
    add include_directories() and add_subdirectory()

You can run tests by running either
    make test
or
    ctest

It looks like enable_testing() is used for basic testing and include (CTest) is needed only to integrate with a Dashboard/CDash. This would allow for nightly testing, continuous testing, and experimental testing.
